# 2D-Gas-Pressure-Model
This model was created for a final project in a Computational Physics course I took at the University of Houston in Fall 2020. The model simulates gas pressure by using random walkers confined to a 2D box to represent gas particles. The random walkers can move in any direction, and are reset and pointed in a new direction any time they would perform a step that would place them outside the simulation box. In one region of the box there is simulated piston that increases a count any time a random walker performs a step that would place it inside the region of the simulated piston, similar to how a gas particle may increase the pressure on a real piston through a collision with it. This count was used as a numerical measure of pressure inside the system.
